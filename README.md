# ATM Console Application

This console application was built using C# programming language and utilizes a SQL Server database for storing and retrieving data. 

The app has a user and admin section. Since this is a simulation of how an actual ATM works, A user uses the ATM app through the details of his/her ATM Card. A user logins with his/her *Card Number* and *Pin*. The ATM app allows users to perform create operations on the database.

The admin can log in with the details below
- Username="admin", Password="2206"
- Username="icecode", Password="6002"

The application allows admin to perform create and read operations. The application also includes validation checks to ensure the user inputs the correct data type and format.
